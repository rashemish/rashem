    <sp>Chinese guard is seen walking on The Great Wall. Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and hits the
        guard on the head knocking his helmet off. The falcon lands on top of a flag pole in front
        of a full moon and lets out a large cry. One grappling hook comes over The Great Wall. The
        guard walks over to the edge and sees many grappling hooks coming towards him</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Guard yelling</speaker>: We're under attack! Light the signal!</sp>
    <sp>Guard runs to the tower and up the ladder as Hun Bald Man #1 and Hun Long Hair Man appear
        trying to stop him. Hun Bald Man #1 breaks the ladder with his sword just as Guard reaches
        the top. The guard picks up the torch to light the fire and sees Shan-Yu jump over the edge
        of the tower and looks at him across from the caldron. The guard throws the torch into the
        caldron lighting a large fire. Shan-Yu watches as each tower lights their caldrons one by
        one</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Guard sternly</speaker>: Now all of China knows you're here.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu taking the flag and holding it over the fire</speaker>: Perfect.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to the palace. The large doors to the central chamber open as General Li walks in
        flanked on his left and right by soldiers and approaches the Emperor. He bows, then looks
        up</sp>
    <sp><speaker>General Li</speaker>: Your Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern border.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: Impossible! No one can get through The Great Wall. The Emperor
        motions for Chi Fu's silence</sp>
    <sp><speaker>General Li</speaker>: Shun-Yu is leading them. We'll set up defenses around your
        palace immediately.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor forcefully</speaker>: No! Send your troops to protect my people. Chi Fu, </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: Yes, your highness.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor</speaker>: Deliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces. Call
        up reserves and as many new recruits as possible.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>General Li</speaker>: Forgive me your Majesty, but I believe my troops can stop
        him.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor</speaker>: I wont take any chances, General. A single grain of rice can tip
        the scale. One man may be the difference between victory and defeat.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan using her chopsticks to single out a grain of rice on top of the mound of
        rice</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Quiet and demure...graceful...polite...picking up some rice with
        her chopsticks and eating a mouthful delicate...refined...poised... She sets down her
        chopsticks and writes down a final word on her right arm punctual. A cock crows Aiya.
        Calling out Little brother. Little brother. Lit- ahhh, there you are. Who's the smartest
        doggie in the world? Come on smart boy, can you help me with my chores today?</sp>
    <sp>Mulan ties a sack of grain around Little Brother's waist. She ties a stick onto Little
        brother so that end of it is in front of Little Brother's face. She ties the bone on the end
        of the stick just out of reach. Little Brother begins to run after the bone which he cannot
        reach. Mulan opens the door for Little Brother and he runs into the door frame, then out the
        open door. Little brother runs by the chickens and Khan - the family horse</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan's Father, Fa Zhou, kneeling and praying before the Fa family's ancestors</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou</speaker>: Honorable ancestors, please help Mulan impress the matchmaker
        today. </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Little Brother running into the temple and around Fa Zhou scattering grain around
            the floor</speaker>: Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.</sp>
    <sp>The chickens follow Little Brother into the temple and begin to feed on the grain</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou</speaker>: Please, PLEASE, help her.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan steps up to the temple seeing Little Brother on his hind legs trying to get the bone.
        Mulan bends the stick down so that Little brother can reach the bone. Little brother gnaws
        on the bone happily. Mulan continues toward the temple</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan calling out</speaker>: Father I brought your--whoop! Fa Zhou bumps into
        Mulan. The cup falls to the ground and Fa Zhou catches the teapot with the handle of his
        cane</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou</speaker>: Mulan--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: I brought a spare. Mulan pulls out a cup from underneath the back
        of her dress and begins to pour the tea </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou</speaker>: Mulan--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan hurried</speaker>: Remember, the doctor said three cups of tea in the
        morning--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou</speaker>: Mulan--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: And three at night. </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou</speaker>: Mulan, you should already be in town. We're counting on you to
        up--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: --uphold the family honor. Don't worry father. I wont let you
        down. Mulan covers over the writing on her arm with here sleeve Wish me luck. Mulan hurries
        down the stairs</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou calling out</speaker>: Hurry! to himself I'm going to...pray some more. Fa
        Zhou turns and walks back into the temple</sp>
    <sp>Cut to the town with Fa Li looking worried</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Bath Lady poking out of her building</speaker>: Fa Li, is your daughter here yet?
        The matchmaker is not a patient woman. She goes back into the building</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Li</speaker>: Of all days to be late. I should have prayed to the ancestors for
        luck.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Grandma Fa walking in with a Cri-Kee in a cage</speaker>: How lucky can they be,
        they're dead. Besides, I've got all the luck we'll need. Speaking to Cri-Kee This is your
        chance to prove yourself. Cri-Kee chirps approvingly. Grandma Fa covers her eyes steps into
        a busy street</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Li excitedly</speaker>: Grandma No!</sp>
    <sp>The traffic barely misses Grandma Fa as she crosses the busy street. But two horse and
        carriage collide causing a big accident. She arrives at the other side of the street,
        uncovers here eyes and looks at Cri-Kee</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Grandma Fa</speaker>: Yep, this cricket's a lucky one. Cri-Kee falls over out of
        fright</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Li sighing in relief</speaker>: Hai.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan arrives on Khan jumping over the recent accident in the street and jumps off with hay
        stuck in her hair</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: I'm here. Seeing a stern look from her mother What? But Mama I had
        to--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Li</speaker>: None of your 'xcuses. Now let's get you cleaned up. They walk
        together into the preparation area</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Song</speaker>: Honor to us all</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Bath Lady</speaker>: all the while Bath Lady undresses Mulan and pushes her into
        the Bath This is what you give me to work with? Well, honey, I've seen worse. We're gonna
        turn this sow's ear Into a silk purse. Bath Lady moves the silk partition aside showing
        Mulan in the bath </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan spoken</speaker>: It's freezing.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Li spoken</speaker>: It would have been warm if you were here on time. </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Bath Lady washing Mulan's hair</speaker>: We'll have you Washed and dried Primped
        and polished till you glow with pride Trust my recipe for instant bride You'll bring honor
        to us all</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Li grabbing a sponge and Mulan's right arm to start cleaning her. She notices
            the writing spoken</speaker>: Mulan, what's this?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan Drawing her arm back and batting her eyelashes spoken</speaker>: Ahh, notes,
        in case I forget something?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Grandma Fa spoken</speaker>: Here, hold this hands the cricket to Fa Li. We'll need
        more luck than I thought. Mulan looks on with an air of disappointment</sp>
    <sp>Cut to the hair dressers</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Hair Dresser 1 Brushing and combing Mulan's hair much to Mulan's chagrin</speaker>:
        Wait and see When we're through</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Hair Dresser 2</speaker>: Boys will gladly go to war for you</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Hair Dresser 1</speaker>: With good fortune </sp>

        great hairdo</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Both</speaker>: You'll bring honor to us all</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Li and others</speaker>: Mulan following her Mother passes a xiangqi game and
        pauses to make an impressive move. Mulan has a smug look on her face when Fa Li comes back
        and drags Mulan away A girl can bring her family Great honor in one way By striking a good
        match And this could be the day</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Dresser 1 Dresser 1, Dresser 2, and Fa Li dress Mulan</speaker>: Men want girls

    <sp><speaker>All Three</speaker>: You'll bring honor to us all </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>: Mulan follows Fa Li and sees boy stealing a doll from a girl.
        Mulan grabs the doll from the boy and returns it to its owner We all must serve our Emperor
        Who guards us from the Huns A man by bearing arms A girl by bearing sons </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Make-up Lady/Fa Li</speaker>: Putting on Mulan's face, powder, lipstick and eye
        liner in a 3 person round When we're through you can't fail Like a lotus blossom soft and
        pale How could any fellow say "No sale" You'll bring honor to us all Make-Up Lady holds a
        mirror so Mulan can see her reflection. Not looking pleased, Mulan takes her single, short
        bang and brings it down in front of her forehead and smiles</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Li spoken. Fa Li places a hair comb in Mulan's hair</speaker>: There, you're
        ready.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Grandma Fa spoken</speaker>: Not yet! An apple for serenity putting an apple in
        Mulan's mouth...A pendant for balance places a yin-yang pendant under her sash sings</sp>
    <sp>Beads of jade for beauty putting beads around Mulan's neck You must proudly show it Grandma
        Fa raises her chin high with her hand Now add a cricket just for luck putting the cage with
        Cri-Kee under Mulan's sash in the back. Cri-Kee doesn't look pleased And even you can't blow
        it</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Walking to catch up with the other maidens Ancestors Hear my plea
        Help me not to make a fool of me And to not uproot my fam'ly tree Keep my father standing

    <sp>All Girls and Mulan arrive before the Matchmaker crouched down behind their parasols. End of
        song</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Matchmaker looking at her clipboard</speaker>: Fa Mulan</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan Jumping up and raising her hand</speaker>: Present.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Matchmaker</speaker>: Speaking without permission.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Oops. </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Grandma Fa to Fa Li</speaker>: Who spit in her bean curd?</sp>
    <sp>Mulan walks into the Matchmaker's building with the Matchmaker following behind and closing
        the door</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Matchmaker looking over Mulan</speaker>: Huh, Hmm, too skinny. Cri-Kee escapes from
        his cage. Mulan struggles to catch him Hmph, not good for bearing sons. Mulan puts Cri-Kee
        in her mouth when Matchmaker turns around to face her Recite the final admonition.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan nodding and smiling</speaker>: Mmm-Hmm. Takes out fan and covers her mouth as
        she spits out Cri-Kee Ptu</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Matchmaker</speaker>: Well...</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan with dignity</speaker>: Fulfill your duties calmly and re...f--looking at her
        arm with smeared writing spectfully. Reflect before you snack surprised, Mulan looks at her
        arm again act. now rapidly This shall bring you honor and glory. Fanning herself rapidly and
        sighing in relief Huh.</sp>
    <sp>Matchmaker snatches the fan and looks at it on both sides looking for notes not finding any.
        Mulan smiles big when Matchmaker looks at her. Matchmaker grabs Mulan's right arm pulling
        her along while smearing the writing and leaving some ink on her hand Hmmm, this way. Now,
        pour the tea Pushing a teapot towards Mulan. To please your future in-laws you must
        demonstrate a sense of dignity Matchmaker smears ink around her mouth. Mulan staring at
        Matchmaker pours some tea onto the table then notices her mistake and pours the tea into the
        cup and refinement. You must also be poised. Mulan notices Cri-kee in the tea-cup as
        Matchmaker takes the cup</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan quiet and timid</speaker>: Um, pardon me.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Matchmaker</speaker>: And silent! Matchmaker sniffs the tea</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan reaching and grabbing the teacup</speaker>: Could I just take that back...one
        moment.</sp>
    <sp>They struggle for the teacup and it turns over on Matchmaker and Cri-kee jumps down
        matchmaker's dress</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Matchmaker</speaker>: Why you clumsy--Matchmaker feels Cri-Kee in her dress and
        dances around Wooo, woooo, wooooooo, Matchmaker knocks over her pot of coals, and sits down
        on the coals. Matchmaker jumps around screaming Ahhhhhhhhhhh Mulan grabs her fan and briskly
        fans the charred area on Matchmaker's behind causing it to flame up. Mulan looks surprised
        about her mistake</sp>
    <sp>Cut to outside Matchmakers building showing Grandma Fa with much noise coming from
        Matchmaker's building</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Grandma Fa to Fa Li</speaker>: I think it's going well, don't you?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Matchmaker running out of the building screaming</speaker>: Put it out! Put it out!
        Put it out! Mulan takes the teapot, throws the tea on Matchmaker and puts out the fire. She
        bows, hands the teapot back to Matchmaker and covers her face as she walks toward Fa Li and
        Grandma Fa with anger You are a disgrace! Matchmaker throws the teapot down smashing it to
        pieces You may look like a bride, but you will never bring your family honor!</sp>
    <sp>The townsfolk who have gathered whisper and walk away</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan walking through the gate with her home leading khan. She looks sorrowful. Fa
        Zhou sees his daughter and smiles. Mulan sees her father's smile. She covers her face with
        Khan's head and leads him to the water trough</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Song</speaker>: Reflection</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Look at me looking at her reflection in the water trough I will
        never pass for a perfect bride taking off her earrings and beads of jade Or a perfect
        daughter Mulan watches Fa Li relating what happened at the Matchmaker's to Fa Zhou Can it be
        I'm not meant to play this part? Mulan releases Cri-Kee back to the wild Now I see That if I
        were to truly To be myself Mulan hops along the bridge railing I would break my family's
        heart</sp>
    <sp>Who is that girl I see Mulan looks into the pond and sees her own reflection Staring
        straight Back at me? Mulan puts her hand on the Great Stone Dragon and looks toward the
        temple Why is my reflection someone I don't know? Cri-Kee rowing across the pond on a lily
        pad Somehow I cannot hide Mulan walking into the family temple Who I am Cri-Kee watches
        Mulan in the temple seeing multiple reflections of herself in the ancestors' stones Though
        I've tried Mulan bows to the ancestors When will my reflection show Who I am inside? Mulan
        finishes wiping off her make-up seeing her reflection in the stones When will my reflection
        show Who I am inside? Mulan gets up and heads out the temple</sp>
    <sp>End of song. Mulan sits on a bench under the blossom tree. Fa Zhou approaches her, clearing
        his throat. Mulan sees him approaching and turns her head away. Fa Zhou sits down beside
        Mulan</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou</speaker>: My, my, what beautiful blossoms we have this year looking up
        into the blossom tree. But look, this one's late. But, I'll bet that when it blooms, it will
        be the most beautiful of all. Mulan and Fa Zhou share smiles. Drums start pounding
        announcing the arrival of Chi Fu and two guards on horseback</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: What is it?</sp>
    <sp>Fa Zhou gets up and walks to the entrance of their house with Mulan following</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Li</speaker>: Mulan, stay inside.</sp>
    <sp>Grandma Fa clears her throat catching Mulan's attention and motions inside. Mulan spies the
        railing near the wall and climbs up to watch over the roof</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: Citizens I bring you a proclamation from the Imperial City: the
        Huns have invaded China! </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Townspeople expressing surprise</speaker>: No!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: By order of the Emperor, one man from every family must serve in
        the Imperial Army. The Xiao family a family member steps up, bows to the guard and takes the
        conscription notice from the guard. The Yi family.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yi's Son holding his old father back</speaker>: I will serve the Emperor in my
        father's place.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: The Fa Family.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: No.</sp>
    <sp>Fa Zhou gives his cane to Fa Li and walks toward Chi Fu. Fa Zhou bows before the
        horsemen</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou standing proud</speaker>: I am ready to serve the Emperor. Fa Zhou reaches
        for the conscription notice</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan running outside to keep her father from taking the conscription
            notice</speaker>: Father, you can't go.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou turning to see his daughter</speaker>: Mulan!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Please sir, my father has already fought bravely--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: Silence! You would do well to teach your daughter to hold her
        tongue in a man's presence.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou looking away from Mulan</speaker>: Mulan, you dishonor me.</sp>
    <sp>Grandma Fa guides Mulan back away</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu handing Fa Zhou the conscription notice</speaker>: Report tomorrow at the Wu
        Shu camp.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou</speaker>: Yes, sir. Fa Zhou walks back into the homestead refusing to take
        his cane from Fa Li</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu fading out as we follow Fa Zhou</speaker>: The Chu family. The Wen family.
        The Chang family. The...</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Fa Zhou in his armory at night. Fa Zhou takes out his sword and practices his
        stances. Whan he balances on his right leg, his leg injury acts up and he falls. Unbeknownst
        to her father, Mulan watches in horror. She breathes heavily</sp>
    <sp>Cut to dinner. The Fa Zhou, Grandma Fa, Fa Li, and Mulan eat in silence. Thunder can be
        heard and lightning can be seen through the opaque window. Mulan pours the tea for her
        family. She slams her teacup down on the table and stands up</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: You shouldn't have to go.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Li</speaker>: Mulan!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: There are plenty of young men to fight for China.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou</speaker>: It is an honor to protect my country and my family.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan angrily</speaker>: So you'll die for honor!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou standing up and angered</speaker>: I will DIE doing what's right.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan starts to speak but is cut off</speaker>: But if you--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou</speaker>: I know my place, it is time you learned yours.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan looking like she's about to cry, turn away from Fa Zhou and runs outside into the rain
        storm and cries</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan sitting at the base of the Great Stone Dragon in the rain. Mulan looks down to
        see her reflection in the puddle caused by the rain. She watches her parents in the bedroom.
        Fa Li turns away from Fa Zhou and walks out of site. Fa Zhou blows out the light. Mulan gets
        up and walks to the Fa Family Temple. Mulan's image reflects off the stone tablets as she
        lights incense and places it in the hanging encense holder. She bows and prays to her
        ancestors. Getting up, Mulan hurries down the steps. Cri-Kee sees her and hops down from
        above and follows her. Mulan goes to her parent's bedroom and takes the conscription notice
        replacing it with the hair comb her mother gave to her. She pauses to give her parents a
        loving, sorrowful look and hurries out. Cut to Mulan in the armory. She opens the cabinet
        with the armor. Using her father's sword, she cuts her hair short and ties it up above her
        head. She finishes putting on the armor and ties it in the front. She takes the sword and
        places it in the scabbard to her left. Cut to Mulan in the stable doorway. Khan rears back
        in fright at the sight of Mulan. Mulan goes forward and comforts Khan letting him know her
        identity. Mulan walks Khan out of the stable, Cri-Kee watches from the ground as she passes
        by. Mulan takes one sorrowful glance back at her parents bedroom and rides Khan through the
        gate and off to camp.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to the face of a statue in the Fa Family Temple. The eyes glow. Cut to Grandma Fa. She
        wakes up with a start rising in bed. Cut to Grandma Fa walking into Fa Li and Fa Zhou's
        bedroom, both are in bed</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Grandma Fa</speaker>: Mulan is gone.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou waking up</speaker>: What? It can't be. Fa Zhou looks at his night stand
        and notices the hair comb in place of his conscription notice. He checks the cabinet and
        sees his armor is gone. He hurries outside calling out Mulan! He stumbles while walking
        because of his leg injury No.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Li kneeling down beside the fallen Fa Zhou</speaker>: You must go after her. She
        could be killed!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou sadly</speaker>: If I reveal her, she will be. Fa Zhou embraces Fa Li</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Grandma Fa</speaker>: Ancestors, hear our prayer: Watch over Mulan.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to the Fa Family Temple. A wind blows out the incense at the base of the center stone.
        The center stone begins to glow as First Ancestor comes to life</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor motioning to a bronze dragon</speaker>: Mushu, awaken!</sp>
    <sp>Mushu comes to life and falls to the ground flat on his back all being obscured by
        smoke</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu rising from the smoke arms stretched out</speaker>: I live! So tell me what
        mortal needs my protection Great Ancestor. You just say the word and I'm there.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor agitated</speaker>: Mushu!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Hey, let me say something. Anybody who is foolish enough to
        threaten our family, vengeance will be MINE. Hrrrrr.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor sternly to silence Mushu</speaker>: Mushu! These are the family
        guardians motioning towards the stone statues on pedestals near the ceiling. They...</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu dejectedly</speaker>: Protect the family.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor pointing to the empty pedestal</speaker>: And you, oh demoted
        one.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: I...ring the gong.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor</speaker>: That's right, now, wake up the ancestors.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: One family reunion coming right up. ringing the gong Okay people,
        people look alive, lets go! C'mon get up. Let's move it, rise and shine. You're way past the
        beauty sleep thing now trust me!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 1</speaker>: I knew it, I knew it. That Mulan was a trouble maker from the
        start.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 3</speaker>: Don't look at me, she gets it from your side of the
        family.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 2</speaker>: She's just trying to help her father.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 4 appearing out of thin air</speaker>: But, if she is discovered, Fa Zhou
        will be forever shamed. Dishonor will come to the family. Traditional values will
        disintegrate.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 5</speaker>: Not to mention they'll lose the farm.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 1</speaker>: My children never caused such trouble. They all became
        acupuncturists.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 3</speaker>: Well, We can't all be acupuncturists.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 6</speaker>: No, your great granddaughter had to be cross-dresser!</sp>
    <sp>All ancestors argue at once, except First Ancestor</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 7</speaker>: Let a guardian bring her back. </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 8 grabbing Mushu and bringing him next to a guardian</speaker>: Yeah,
        awaken the most cunning.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 4 taking Mushu and holding him next to the stone rabbit
        guardian</speaker>: No, the swiftest.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 9 grabbing Mushu and holding him next to the stone monkey
            guardian</speaker>: No, send the wisest.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor</speaker>: Silence! We must send the most powerful of all Motioning
        to the Great Stone Dragon as it is seen through the window</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu climbs up the empty guardian post laughing</speaker>: Ho, ho, heh, heh. Okay,
        okay, I get the drift, I'll go. All Ancestors give a quick look of surprise and laugh
        uncontrollably You all don't think I can do it. Watch this here. Mushu produces a small
        flame from his mouth Ah, ha, Jump back, I'm pretty hot huh. Don't make me have to singe
        nobody to prove no point.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor grabbing Mushu and pulling away from the post</speaker>: You had
        your chance to protect the Fa family.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 6</speaker>: Your mis-guidance led Fa Deng to disaster.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Deng with his decapitated head on his lap</speaker>: Yeah, thanks a lot.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: And your point is?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor</speaker>: The point is we will be sending a real dragon to retrieve
        Mulan.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: What? But I'm a real dragon.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor grabbing Mushu and pulling him away from the guardian post as Mushu
            fights to hold on</speaker>: You are not worthy of this spot. Now, awaken the Great
        Stone Dragon. First Ancestor throws Mushu out of the temple</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu looking back into the temple</speaker>: So you'll get back to me on the job
        thing.</sp>
    <sp>An ancestor throws Mushu's gong and hits Mushu in the face</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu walking with a slouch and banging the gong on the ground</speaker>: Just one
        chance is that too much to ask? I mean, it's not like it'll kill ya.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu rings the gong and looks at the Great Stone Dragon</speaker>: Yo rocky, wake
        up! You gotta go fetch Mulan. pauses as nothing happens. Mushu walks over to the side of the
        statue C'mon boy, go get her, go on, throws the gong stick off the screen and whistles Come
        on. Angrily while climbing up the Great Stone Dragon Grrr, Grrrr. speaking in his ear and
        banging the ear with the gong Hello, helloooooo. curtly Hello bangs the gong extra hard
        against the ear causing it to break off. Uh oh. The Great Stone Dragon crumbles to the
        ground, head intact minus the ear. knocks on the dragon's head Uh, Stoney, Stooooneeey. Oh
        man, they're gonna kill me!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor calling out through the temple window</speaker>: Great Stone Dragon,
        have you awaken? </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu holding the head of the Great Stone Dragon up to that First Ancestor can only
            see it's head and Mushu's body</speaker>: Uhhh, Yes, I just woke up. And I am the Great
        Stone Dragon, good morning Mushu waves. I will go forth and fetch Mulan. Did, did I mention
        that I was the Great Stone Dragon?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor</speaker>: Go, The fate of the Fa Family rests in your claws.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Don't even worry about it, I will not lose face. Mushu falls down
        the hill under the weight of the Great Stone Dragon's head and lands on the dragon's
        pedestal with the head falling on top of him</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu muffled</speaker>: Ow, my elbow. Aw, aw, I know I twisted something. Throwing
        the head off him That's just great. Now what? I'm doomed! And all 'cause miss man decides to
        take her little drag show on the road.</sp>
    <sp>Cri-Kee enters stage right</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Cri-Kee</speaker>: Chirp, Chirp.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Go get her? What's the matter with you? After this great stone
        Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd have to bring her home with a medal to get back in the temple. Wait
        a minute, that's it! I make Mulan a war hero, then they'll be begging me to come back to
        work. That's the master plan. Oh, you've gone and done it now. Mushu runs off stage
        right</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Cri-Kee hopping along side of Mushu</speaker>: Chirp. Chirp Chirp Chirp.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu pushing Cri-Kee away</speaker>: Hey, what makes you think you're coming?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Cri-Kee</speaker>: Chirp, Chirp. </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: You're lucky? Ho, ho, heh. Do I look like a sucker to you?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Cri-Kee</speaker>: Chirp. Chirp.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Whach' you mean loser? How 'bout I pop one of your antenna's off
        and throw it across the yard. Then who's a loser, me or you?</sp>
    <sp>Interlude</sp>

        motions stage right. Hun Archer, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Long-Hair Guy dismount and walk into
        the forest. They throw down two Imperial scouts before the rest of the army</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Hun Long-Hair Guy</speaker>: Imperial scouts. </sp>
    <sp>Shan Yu dismounts and walks towards the scouts</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Scout #1</speaker>: Shan-Yu.</sp>

        Stop me? He invited me. By building his wall, he challenged my strength. Well I'm here to
        play his game Shan-Yu throws Scout #2 to the ground and points his sword at Scout #1 as he
        gets up and runs calling out to the scouts Go! Tell your emperor to send his strongest
        armies. Quietly I'm ready. </sp>
    <sp>The Imperial Scouts run off towards the palace</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu scratching his chin</speaker>: How many men does it take to deliver a
        message.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Archer Guy drawing back his bow</speaker>: One.</sp>
    <sp>End Interlude</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan on a hill outside of the camp. Khan is sitting watching</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Okay, okay, how 'bout this? Ahem, in her manly voice excuse me,
        where do I sign in? Hah, I see you have a sword. I have one too. They're very manly and
        tough Mulan bites her lip as she mishandles pulling the sword out of the scabbard and it
        falls to the ground. Khan rolls on his back in laughter. Mulan throws her shoe and hits Khan
        in the head with it quieting Khan. I'm working on it. Who am I fooling? It's going to take a
        miracle to get me into the army.</sp>
    <sp>Mushu appears as a giant shadow being cast on a rock with flames on either side. Mushu's
        real appearance remains out of sight</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu in a Southern Baptist Preacher's voice</speaker>: Did I hear someone ask for
        a miracle!? Let me hear you say aye!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan Running and hiding behind a rock</speaker>: Ahhhhhh.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: That's close enough.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan from behind a rock</speaker>: Ghost.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Get ready Mulan your serpentine salvation is at hand. For I have
        been sent by your ancestors-- notices Cri-Kee making a hand shadow of a dragon on the rock
        and stamps him down with his foot to guide you through your masquerade. bending down to
        Cri-Kee C'mon, you're gonna stay you're gonna work. returning to Mulan Heed my word, 'cause
        if the army finds out that you are a girl, the penalty is death. big flames shoot up from
        the rocks</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Who are you?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Who am I? Who am I? I am the guardian of lost souls. Mulan smiles
        big in anticipation of seeing her guardian I am the powerful, the pleasurable, the
        indestructible coming out from the rocks to show his real size Mushu! Oh hah, hah, pretty
        hot, huh? Khan stomps on Mushu. Mulan pushes Khan back</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Ah, my ancestors sent a little lizard to help me?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Hey, dragon, dragon, not lizard. I don't do that tongue thing
        flips out his tongue to show Mulan what he means.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: You're uh...</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Intimidating? Awe inspiring?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan making a hand gesture to denote his smallness of size</speaker>: Tiny.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu with a look of disappointment</speaker>: Of course. I'm travel size for your
        convenience. If I was my real size, your cow here patting Khan on the nose would die of
        fright. Khan tries to bite Mushu pointing to the ground speaking to Khan Down Bessy. My
        powers are beyond your mortal imagination. For instance, leaning in and looking at Mulan's
        chest my eyes can see straight through your armor. Mulan cover her bust with her left arm
        and slaps Mushu with the right Ow. angrily All right, that's it! Dishonor! Dishonor on your
        whole family. aside to Cri-Kee Make a note of this Cri-Kee grabs a leaf and a pen and starts
        writing. Loudly with gusto Dishonor on you. Dishonor on your cow. Dis-</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan pleadingly while covering Mushu's mouth</speaker>: Stop! I'm sorry, I'm sorry
        kneeling down in front of Mushu. I'm just nervous. I've never done this before.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Then you're gonna have to trust me. And don't you slap me no more,
        we clear on that? Mulan nods emphatically. All right. Okey dokey, let's get this show on the
        road. Cri-Kee, get the bags Mushu starts walking to the camp. to Khan Let's move it
        heifer.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan at the camp's entrance</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu hiding in Mulan's armor poking his head out from her back</speaker>: Okay
        this is it, time to show 'em your man walk. Shoulders back, chest high, feet apart, head up
        Mushu pulls Mulan's head back ...and strut 2, 3, break it down, 2, 3 and work it, Mulan
        walks into the camp drawing the attention the men who see her. Mulan walks into a tent and
        sees a man picking his nose and another man picking out dirt from between his toes with
        chopsticks Beautiful isn't it?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan making a face of disgust and continuing to walk</speaker>: They're
        disgusting.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: No, they're men. And you're going to have to act just like them,
        so pay attention.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan stops and watches Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and Tattoo Soldier</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Tattoo Soldier showing the dragon tattoo on his chest and belly</speaker>: Look,
        this tattoo will protect me from harm.</sp>
    <sp>Yao thinks for a moment, then punches Tattoo Soldier in the stomach causing Ling to laugh.
        Mulan watches in utter amazement. Yao kisses his hand</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ling laughing</speaker>: I hope you can get your money back.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: I don't think I can do this.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: It's all attitude. Be tough like this guy here looking at
        Yao.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan looks at Yao as he hocks up a loogie and spits</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao noticing Mulan watching him</speaker>: What are you looking at?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Punch him, it's how men say 'hello.'</sp>
    <sp>Mulan looks at her fist, then punches Yao from behind on the shoulder. The force causes Yao
        to run into Chien-Po</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chien-Po</speaker>: Oh Yao, you made a friend.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Good, Now slap him on the behind, they like that.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan slaps Yao on the behind</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao</speaker>: Wu hoo hooooo. grabbing Mulan buy the collar I'm going to hit you so
        hard it'll make your ancestors dizzy.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chien-Po Holding and picking up Yao</speaker>: Yao, relax and chant with me.
        Yaaaaaaa Moouuuu Ahhhhhh Doooou Fuuuu Daaaaa.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao</speaker>: Ya Mi Ah To Fu Da.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chien-Po</speaker>: Feel better? </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao relaxed</speaker>: Yeah. Chien-Po places Yao back on the ground to Mulan while
        walking away Aaaaa, you ain't worth my time chicken boy.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu loudly</speaker>: Chicken boy!? Say that to my face ya limp noodle!</sp>
    <sp>Yao grabs Mulan by the collar cocking back his arm to punch. Mulan ducks as Yao hits Ling
        standing behind her</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao</speaker>: Oh, sorry Ling. Hey!</sp>
    <sp>Yao grabs Mulan's foot as she starts to crawl away. Ling kicks Yao on the butt causing him
        to land on Chien-Po's stomach. Ling Jump attacks Mulan, but she ducks and he lands on Yao on
        top of Chien-Po</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ling</speaker>: You're dead. They fight on top of Chien-Po. Mulan runs away. Ling
        notices Mulan and then points toward her Oh, there he goes.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan runs into a tent and stops. Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (in that order) run through the
        tent. Yao stops short as he is about to run into a soldier in a line for food. He looks
        behind him with concerned eyes as Ling stops in time. Chien-Po bumps into Ling causing the
        entire line of soldiers to fall forward and knock over the pot of congee and the cook behind
        it. The men look to the back of the line and spy Mulan who has emerged from the tent. They
        angrily start walking towards her. Mulan has a look of horror on her face as if trouble is
        about to brew</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Hey guys. </sp>
    <sp>Chi Fu watches and then walks into the tent. General Li and Li Shang are in the tent.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>General Li motioning with his pointer to a map of the region</speaker>: The Huns
        have struck here, here and here. I will take the main troops up to the Tung Shao Pass and
        stop Shan-Yu before he destroys this village.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: Excellent strategy, Sir. I do love surprises, Ha ha, ha, ha.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>General Li</speaker>: You will stay here and train the new recruits. When Chi Fu
        believes you're ready, you will join us...Captain. General Li hands a sword to Shang</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Captain?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: Oh, this is an enormous responsibility, General. Uh, perhaps a
        soldier with more experience--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>General Li</speaker>: Number one in his class, extensive knowledge of training
        techniques, leaning back smugly stroking his chin an impressive military lineage. I believe
        Li Shang will do an excellent job.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang excitedly</speaker>: Oh, I will. I wont let you down. This is, I mean,
        I...somberly yes sir.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>General Li gets up and starts walking out of the tent</speaker>: Very good then.

        three weeks.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu to Shang</speaker>: And I wont leave anything out. exits through the
        tent</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang while tying his sword to his uniform</speaker>: Captain Li Shang, Hmmm,
        leader of China's finest troops. No, the greatest troops of all time. Heh, heh, heh, heh.
        Shang walks out of the tent to see the recruits fighting. He stands stage left of Chi Fu and
        General Li. Injured Recruit sees the General and salutes him as he falls to the ground.
        General Li steps over Injured Recruit and mounts his horse</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: Most impressive.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>General Li</speaker>: Good luck Captain. The general and his mounted troops leave
        the camp</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang quietly, to himself</speaker>: Good luck, Father. Shang looks at his troops
        and sighs</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu smirking, with board and brush in hand</speaker>: Day one.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang shouting</speaker>: Soldiers!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>All Recruits backing away revealing Mulan and pointing at her. Mulan is crouching
            in the fetal position on the ground</speaker>: He started it!</sp>
    <sp>Shang approaches Mulan and looks down over her. Mulan looks up, sees Shang over top of her
        and gets up quickly dusting herself off</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang to Mulan</speaker>: I don't need anyone causing trouble in my camp!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Sorry, in her man voice Uhh, I mean, sorry you had to see that.
        with her fist she taps Shang on the shoulder You know how it is when you get those, uh
        pounding her chest manly urges and you just have to kill something slapping her hand, fix
        things, uh, cook outdoors.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: What's your name?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan stumbling</speaker>: Ahh, I, uhhh, I, uh--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu stepping into Mulan's face</speaker>: Your commanding officer just asked you
        a question.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Uhh, I've got a name. Huh. And it's a boys name too.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu from the back of Mulan</speaker>: Ling, How 'bout Ling?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan to Mushu motioning with her head to Ling</speaker>: His name's Ling.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: I didn't ask for his name. I asked for yours.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Try, uh, ahh, Chu!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Ah Chu.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Ah Chu?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Gesundheit. He He, I kill myself.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan whispering over her shoulder</speaker>: Mushu.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Mushu?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: No.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Then what is it!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Ping! Ping was my best friend growing up!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: It's Ping.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Ping.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Of course Ping DID steal my gir-Mulan reaches back and grabs holds
        Mushu's mouth together</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Yes, my name is Ping.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Let me see your conscription notice. Takes the notice from Mulan
        Fa Zhou, *the* Fa Zhou?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Um, he...doesn't talk about me much. Mulan tries to hawk up a
        loogie and spit but the saliva just runs from her mouth. The recruits laugh</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: I can see why, the boy's an absolute lunatic.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang to the recruits</speaker>: Okay gentlemen, thanks to your new friend Ping,
        you'll spend tonight picking up every single grain of rice. And tomorrow, the real work
        begins.</sp>
    <sp>All recruits growl at Mulan</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu Popping out the front of Mulan's armor</speaker>: You know, we have to work
        on your people skills.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan sleeping in her tent. Mushu winds up Cri-Kee's wings. Cri-Kee rings like an
        alarm clock</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: All right, rise and shine sleeping beauty. Mulan rises and blinks
        C'mon rapping on Mulan's head with each syllable hup, hup, hup. Mulan groans, lies back down
        and pulls the covers over her head. Mushu pulls the covers off Mulan entirely Get your
        clothes on. Get ready. Got breakfast for ya. Mushu jumps onto Mulan's knee with a bowl of
        porridge Look, you get porridge, and it's happy to see you. Mushu shows her the bowl with
        two eggs and bacon looking like a smiley face. Cri-Kee pops up out from the bowl of porridge
        Hey, get outta there, you gonna make people sick! Mushu uses chopsticks to push Cri-Kee out
        of the porridge</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Am I late?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu while feeding Mulan</speaker>: No time to talk. Now remember, it's your first
        day of training so listen to your teacher and no fighting. Play nice with the other kids,
        unless of course one of the other kids wanna fight, then you have to kick the other kid's
        butt.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan with her mouth full of food</speaker>: But I don't wanna kick the other kid's
        butt.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Don't talk with your mouth full. Now let's see your war face Mulan
        looks at him with wide eyes and chipmunk cheeks full of food. I think my bunny slippers just
        ran for cover. C'mon scare me, girl! </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan swallows the food</speaker>: Rrrrrrr!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu rolling back into the half eaten bowl of porridge</speaker>: Oh, that's my
        tough looking warrior. That's what I'm talking about. Now get out there and make me proud.
        Mushu ties up Mulan's hair</sp>
    <sp>Khan whinnies and pokes his head into the tent</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: What do you mean the troops just left? </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan acting surprised</speaker>: They what!? Mulan hurriedly puts on her clothes
        and jumps out of the tent going off to join the other recruits </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu running out from the tent calling after Mulan</speaker>: Wait, you forgot
        your sword. My little baby off to destroy people sniffle.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to the troops muddling around near Shang's tent</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu enters stage left</speaker>: Order people, order!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Recruit #2</speaker>: I'd like a pan fried noodle.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chien-Po</speaker>: Oh, oh, sweet and pungent shrimp Ling and others begin to
        laugh</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Recruit #3</speaker>: Moo goo gai pan</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: That's not funny.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan comes running up to the group</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ling noticing Mulan's arrival</speaker>: Looks like our new friend slept in this
        morning. Mulan stops between Ling and Yao to Ping Hellooo Ping, Are you hungry?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao</speaker>: Yeah, 'cause I owe you a knuckle sandwich. grabs Mulan by the shirt
        collar drawing back his other arm. Mulan hides her face with her hands. Ling looks away,
        closes his eyes, and puts his fingers in his ears so that he wont hear anything</sp>
    <sp><speaker>All Soldiers in agreement with Yao</speaker>: Yeah.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang loudly</speaker>: Soldiers! The soldiers line up quicky. Shang takes off his
        shirt and grabs a bow and quiver of arrows. Mulan is duly impressed by Shang's physique You
        will assemble swiftly and silently every morning. Shang walks down the line of soldiers
        Anyone who acts otherwise will answer to me.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao</speaker>: Ooooo, tough guy.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang turning around with knocked arrow pointing towards Yao</speaker>: Yao. All
        recruits take a step back leaving Yao one step forward. Shang Points arrow skyward and
        shoots it into the top of a high pole Thank you for volunteering. Retrieve the arrow.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao bows to Shang</speaker>: I'll get that arrow pretty boy. And I'll do it with my
        shirt on. Yao prepares to leap onto that pole</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: One moment, you seem to be missing something. Chi Fu brings out
        two large bronze disks. Shang takes out one disk and holds it high speaking to all the
        troops This represents discipline Shang hands the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the
        ground taking Yao's arm with it and this represents strength Shang hands the other weight to
        Yao making him fall to the ground. The troops laugh while Mulan looks concerned. You need
        both to reach the arrow.</sp>
    <sp>Yao climbs up the pole then slips down under the weight. Ling, Chien-Po, and Mulan each take
        their turn and fall down. Mulan rubs her behind as she walks away in front of Shang</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: We've got a long way to go.</sp>
    <sp>Song I'll Make a Man Out of You</sp>
    <sp>Shang throws staffs to the soldiers. Yao intercepts Mulan's staff and trips her with it</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Let's get down to business-- to defeat the Huns.</sp>
    <sp>Shang throws up two clay pots and breaks them apart with his staff. The troops are highly
        impressed</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Recruits putting their staffs out at arms length, spoken</speaker>: Hua</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons? Ling puts a
        cricket down Mulan's back causing her to flail erratically You're the saddest bunch I ever
        met Most soldiers fall as Mulan moves uncontrollably But you can bet before we're through
        Shang does a somersault in the air landing near Mulan. He takes a pole in the stomach. Shang
        stops Mulan and takes her staff. He grabs her by the collar Mister, I'll make a man out of
        you </sp>
    <sp>Shang steps on a lever throwing up 3 targets which he hits with 3 arrows from one bow
        Tranquil as a forest The recruits try and fail. Mulan gets ready to fire when Mushu sticks a
        target on her arrow before she shoots. Mulan looks at Mushu's in shock and pauses. Shang
        looks disdainfully at Mulan as she cracks a huge smile But on fire within Shang balances a
        bucket of water on his head holding a staff. The recruits fire stones at him which Shang
        deflect with the staff Once you find your center You are sure to win Mulan wobbles with the
        bucket of water on her head. As the recruits throw stones at her the bucket tips over onto
        her head You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot And you haven't got a clue Shang throws his
        hand down into a river and retrieves a fish. Mulan throws her hand down into the river and
        retrieve's Yao's foot. Mushu comes out of the water with a fish in hand to give to Mulan
        Somehow I'll make a man out of you!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chien-Po running through a field of fire arrows</speaker>: I'm never gonna catch my
        breath</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao following Chien-Po, falls and gets hit in the butt with an arrow</speaker>: Say
        good-bye to those who knew me</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ling Banging his head on a stone slab</speaker>: Boy I was a fool in school for
        cutting gym</sp>
    <sp>Shang practices martial arts with Mulan. With a punch to the face he knocks her back into a
        tree</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu from the tree acts as a boxing coach</speaker>: This guy's got 'em scared to
        death</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan Mushu pushes Mulan back out into the ring</speaker>: Hope he doesn't see
        right through me</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chien-Po stops as he's hopping across poles protruding from water causing Shang and
            the recruits to pile into him</speaker>: Now I really wish that I knew how to swim!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang and Chorus</speaker>: Cannon fire misses the target in the middle of an open
        field. Ling kicks the support structure out from Mulan's cannon and it begins to fall. Mulan
        quickly grabs the cannon and it fires high and back towards the camp landing and exploding

            on each side. They march up a mountain</speaker>: Time is racing toward us till the Huns
        arrive Chi Fu points Shang's eyes back to a struggling Mulan who falls to the ground.
        Cri-Kee and Mushu try to pick her up but hide when Shang comes up to her. Shang picks up her
        pole with grain, puts it on top of his and returns to the troops. Mulan looks rejected Heed
        my every order and you might survive Shang hand the reigns of Khan to Mulan You're unsuited
        for the rage of war So pack up, go home, you're through How could I make a man out of
        you?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang and Chorus Mulan takes the weights and tries to climb the pole
            again</speaker>: (Be a man) We must be swift as the coursing river Mulan ties the
        weights together behind the pole and uses the cloth to help her shimmy up the pole (Be a

    <sp>Interlude</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Shan Yu sitting on top of a tree. He cuts off the very top with his sword. His falcon
        swoops buy and drops a doll. Shan-Yu takes the doll, sniffs it, looks surprised, and drops

    <sp><speaker>Long Hair Hun Man sniffing the doll</speaker>: Sulfur, from cannons.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu</speaker>: This doll came from a village in the Tung Shao Pass, where the
        Imperial Army's waiting for us.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Hun Archer</speaker>: We can avoid them easily.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu shaking his head</speaker>: No, the quickest way to the Emperor is through
        that pass. Besides, the little girl will be missing her doll. We should return it to
        her.</sp>
    <sp>End Interlude</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan by the lake with Mushu, Khan, and Cri-Kee</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Hey, oh, ah, no, this is not a good idea. What if somebody sees
        you?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan from behind the reeds</speaker>: Just because I look like a man doesn't mean
        I have to smell like one. </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu holding a towel covering his eyes with his ears</speaker>: So a couple of
        guys don't rinse out their socks, picky, picky, picky. Well myself I kinda like that corn
        chip's smell.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan running by Mushu and jumps into the lake splashing water on Mushu</speaker>:
        Ahhhhhhh.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Okay, all right, all right, that's enough. Now, c'mon, get out
        before you get all pruny and stuff holding out a towel towards Mulan keeping his eyes
        covered.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Mushu, if you're so worried, go stand watch.</sp>

        smacking him in the face with colored boxers</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu gasps</speaker>: Ah. We're doomed! There a couple of things I know they're
        bound to notice!</sp>
    <sp>Yao and Ling jump into the water. Chien-Po dips in his toe to check temperature then jumps
        in causing a large wave. Yao and Ling ride the wave towards Mulan. Mulan sees them and hides
        her face behind a lily pad</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao calling</speaker>: Hey, Ping.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan peeks over the lily pad and spreads it on the water covering her chest</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan speaking nervously and unnaturally in a manly voice</speaker>: Oh hi guys, I
        didn't know you were *here*. Yao, Ling and Chien-Po share "this boy is strange" looks I was
        just washing, so now I'm clean and I'm gonna go. Bye, bye. Mulan hides behind a rock keeping
        her front facing the rock</sp>

        before so lets start over. extending his hand to shake hands with Mulan Hi, I'm Ling!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan covering her chest with her left arm, she turns and shakes his hand with an
            outstretched right arm, smiling</speaker>: Heh, heh. Mulan turns and wades away from
        Ling and runs into Chien-Po</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chien-Po taking a lily pad off his head</speaker>: And I'm Chien-Po.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan waving slightly and smiling</speaker>: Hello Chien-Po.</sp>
    <sp>Yao stands on top of a rock looking down at the others. Mulan looks down into the water and
        hides her eyes with her free hand</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao</speaker>: And I am Yao, king of the rock. And there's nothin' you girls can do
        about it.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ling taking a fighting stance</speaker>: Oh, yeah? Well, I think Ping elbowing
        Mulan and I could take you.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan wading away</speaker>: I really don't want to take him anywhere.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ling following Mulan</speaker>: Ping, we have to fight!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: No we don't. unnaturally We could just close our eyes and swim
        around.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ling</speaker>: C'mon don't be such a g--Ouch! Something bit me.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu popping out of the water between Mulan and Ling</speaker>: What a nasty
        flavor.</sp>

    <sp><speaker>Chien-Po while all three of them climb up the rock and on each other</speaker>:
        Snake, snake.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan whistles for Khan and wades back to shore. Khan comes close enough to shore and Mulan
        hides behind Khan as she wraps a towel around her body</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Yao, Ling and Chien-Po calmed down sitting on the rock</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ling</speaker>: Some king of the rock! Yao pushes him off the rock</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan with towel wrapped around her</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Boy, that was close.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu brushing his teeth</speaker>: No, that was vile! You owe me big!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: I never want to see a naked man again. the rest of the troops run
        by naked and jump into the lake</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Hey, don't look at me. I ain't biting any more butts.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan outside Chi Fu's Tent having dressed fully. Chi Fu and Shang are talking from
        inside</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu fading in</speaker>: You think your troops are ready to fight? Hah! They
        would not last a minute against the Huns. </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: They completed their training.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: Those *boys* are no more fit to be soldiers than you are to be
        Captain. Once the general reads my report, your troops will never see battle.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu from outside the tent</speaker>: Oh no you don't. I've worked to hard to get
        Mulan into this war. to Cri-Kee This guy's messing with my plan.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang grabbing onto the front of Chi Fu's clip board</speaker>: We're not

        Shang walks by without reacting or not. calling out to Shang For what it's worth, I think
        you're a great captain. Shang pauses to glance back, then continues forward</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu looking at Mulan's fixed gaze on Shang</speaker>: I saw that!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan innocently</speaker>: What?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu teasing</speaker>: You like him don't you?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: No, I--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Yeah right, Yeah sure. Look, pointing to Mulan's tent go to your
        tent. Mulan walks away with a look of delight. Mushu talks to Cri-Kee I think it's time we
        took this war into our own hands rubbing hands together.</sp>
    <sp>Mushu and Cri-Kee wait outside Chi Fu's Tent. Chi Fu emerges with carrying a scrub brush and
        wrapped in a towel and with big showering slippers on his feet. He whistles as he walks off.
        Mushu and Cri-Kee enter his tent. Cri-Kee uses his legs to write up a letter. He finishes
        and Mushu takes the paper</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Okay, okay, let me see what you've got. From General Li, dear son,
        we're waiting for the huns at the pass and it would mean a lot if you'd come and back us up.
        sarcastically That's great except you forgot, "and since we're all out of potpourri, maybe
        you wouldn't mind bringing up some." Hellooooo, this is the army! Make it sound more urgent,

        with water from his mouth</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Chi Fu walking out of the lake wrapped in a towel, sounds of laughter can be heart
        from the troops</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu muttering</speaker>: Insubordinate ruffians. then calling to the troops You

    <sp><speaker>Mushu sitting on top of the panda bear behind a dummy of a soldier using sticks to
            gesticulate with the dummy's arms to push the note towards Chi Fu. Cri-Kee works the
            mouth</speaker>: Urgent news from the general! Chi Fu looks over the panda What's the
        matter, you've never seen a 'black and white' before?</sp>

    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Excuse me! I think the question is: who are you? We're in a war
        man! There's no time for stupid questions. I should have your hat for that, the panda starts
        walking forward snatch it right off of your head swiping with an arm at Chi Fu's hat. Mushu
        turns the upper half of the dummy around after the panda passes Chi Fu. Chi Fu begins
        reading the message. But I'm feeling gracious today, so carry on before I report you. the
        panda walks up a tree taking Mushu and Cri-Kee with him out of sight</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu looking around for Mushu but not finding him, then runs into Shang's
            tent</speaker>: Captain. Urgent news from the General. We're needed at the front.</sp>

    <sp><speaker>Chien-Po Chien-Po and a woman circle around then land on the edge of a large bowl

        Nah!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ling grabbing Mulan's shoulder and leaning on her, she takes his hand off and
            shakes her head disapprovingly. Ling leans against the carriage of cannons</speaker>: My
        manly ways and turns of phrase are sure to thrill her</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao hitting Khan so that the carriage runs out from under Ling. Ling looks upset

        poking up out of the snow, armor lying face down, broken cannon carts. Ling, Yao, Mulan, and
        a soldier have the look of horror on their faces as they look into the valley. Chien-Po
        walks up from the valley carrying a helmet</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chien-po handing the helmet to Shang</speaker>: ...the General.</sp>
    <sp>Shang takes the helmet and walks to the edge of the hill. He draws his sword and stabs it
        into the snow upright. He kneels down and places the helmet on top of the sword. Mulan
        approaches him from behind</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan softly</speaker>: I'm sorry.</sp>
    <sp>Shang gets up, turns around and puts his hand on Mulan's shoulder and he walks by. Shang
        walks to the center of the troops. He grabs his horse by the saddle, takes one quick look of
        grief then mounts his horse</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: The Huns are moving quickly. We'll make better time to the
        Imperial City through the Tung Shao Pass. We're the only hope for the Emperor now. Move
        out!</sp>
    <sp>Mulan looks at the sword, takes out the doll she found and places the doll at the base of
        the sword. She turns around and joins the rest of the troops marching on</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan standing next to Khan saddled to the cart with cannons. A cannon blast shoots
        out of the cart and explodes in the air. The troops look surprised. Mulan glances back with
        a scowl into the hole in the canopy of the cart to see Mushu with a sorrowful face. Mushu
        points at Cri-Kee. Shang charges up to Mulan on his horse, Chi Fu right behind</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang angrily</speaker>: What happened?!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan stumbling</speaker>: Uhhh--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: You just gave away our position. Now we're--an arrow hits Shang in
        the shoulder as he falls to the ground. Shang pulls out the arrow calling out Get out of
        range!!</sp>
    <sp>The troops hurriedly run away as many arrows start falling all around them. Mulan pulls Khan
        by the reins to hurry him up. Fire arrows start hitting the cart with cannons attached to
        Khan. The cart begins to blaze with fire</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Save the cannons!</sp>
    <sp>The troops form a human chain and start taking the cannons out of the burning cart one by
        one while Mulan steadies Khan to keep him from bolting. Chien-Po grabs many and hauls them
        on his own. The troops grabas many cannons as they safely can and Mulan cuts Khan free from
        the cart. She mounts Khan and charges away from the fire. The cart explodes sending Mulan
        flying off Khan losing her helmet and sword which land near her. Mushu and Cri-Kee, sent
        flying by the blast, scream and land near Mulan.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Oh sure, save the horse.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan grabs Mushu with her right hand and grabs the sword with her left and runs to the
        troops position. Cri-Kee and Khan follow. Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and other recruits set up
        cannons against rocks. They dodge a set of arrows that fall around them</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Fire!</sp>
    <sp>They launch a volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed. As the cannon fire
        explodes, Shan-Yu's army hides</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Fire!</sp>
    <sp>Mulan, Ling and Chien-Po launch a second volley at the mountain where the archers are
        stationed. No more arrows can be seen coming from the mountain position</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Hold the last cannon. Yao poised to light his cannon, pauses.
        Shan-Yu and his troops appear at the top of the mountain Prepare to fight. If we die, we die
        with honor.</sp>
    <sp>Shan-Yu raises his sword high above his head and charges down the mountain at Shang's
        position. His falcon flies off his shoulder on Shan-Yu's war cry The Hun army follows</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu.</sp>
    <sp>The line of Shang's troops with Mulan at the end draw their swords. Mulan looks down at her
        sword and sees the reflection of a large snow embankment hanging to the side of a cliff. She
        rushes forward</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao being pushed aside by Mulan as she grabs the cannon</speaker>: Hey. Shang:
        Ping, come back. Ping!</sp>
    <sp>Mulan charges forward towards the oncoming horde of the Hun army being led by Shan-Yu and
        his falcon. Mushu looks over her at the oncoming horde with worry in his eyes</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang starting to run after her waving his arms</speaker>: Stop!</sp>
    <sp>Mulan plants the cannon and aims it for the cliff with the snow overhang</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu seeing Shan-Yu riding closer to their position</speaker>: All right, you
        might want to light that right about now. Quickly! Quickly!</sp>
    <sp>Mulan takes out the flint and tries to light the fuse. Shan-Yu's falcon swoops buy knocking
        Mulan down scattering the flint rock</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao speaking to Ling and Chien-Po</speaker>: C'mon, we've gotta help. they charge
        towards Mulan's position</sp>
    <sp>Mulan searches for the flint in the snow in vain. She sees Mushu, grabs him and stretches
        him causing him to light the fuse. Mushu lands on the cannon and the cannon fires off just
        above the charging Shan-Yu</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu tailing off as he rides the cannon toward the snow embankment</speaker>: You
        missed him! How could you miss? He was three feet in front of you!</sp>
    <sp>The cannon lodges in the snow and explodes causing the beginning of a large avalanche. Mulan
        looks up with an evil grin on her face and Shan-Yu watches in horror as many of his troops
        begin to be swallowed up by the snow</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu recollecting himself and focusing in on Mulan</speaker>: Yrrrrrrraah. </sp>
    <sp>Shan-Yu swipes at Mulan with his sword hitting her in the right side. Mulan falls back
        grabbing her right side. Shan-Yu's horse stumbles. Mulan uses this break to bolt away from
        the avalanche. Shan-Yu gains his composure and starts to gallop away from the avalanche on
        his horse. Shang looks with shock as hee sees the avalanche coming toward him. Mulan grabs
        Shang as she passes by him, turning him around and helping him run away from the
        avalanche</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao, Chien-Po and Ling running towards the oncoming avalanche</speaker>:
        Yeeahhhhhh! they stop. noticing the oncoming avalanche they turn around and run back to
        where they came from Waaaaaaaaaa!</sp>
    <sp>Khan jumps away from the troops position and starts to run towards Mulan passing Ling, Yao
        and Chien-Po. The avalanche swallows up Shan-Yu and his horse. Khan arrives at Mulan's
        position just ahead of the avalanche. Mulan jumps onto Khan and reaches for Shang. She grabs
        his hand, then the avalanche rushes forth breaking their grip, turning Khan around facing
        the oncoming avalanche of snow</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Ling, Yao and Chien-Po standing behind a rock. They see the snow approaching close
        and run to larger shelter where the rest of Shang's army is positioned just as the avalance
        reaches their posision</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mushu riding down the snow on a shield</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu calling out</speaker>: Mulan! Mulan! seeing hair sticking up from the snow
        Mulan? Mushu picks up the Hun by the hair</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Hun Soldier</speaker>: Arrrrr.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu pushing the hun soldier back under the snow</speaker>: Nope. Mulan! Mushu
        picks up Cri-Kee out of the snow Man, you are one lucky bug.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan riding Khan above the snow into the teeth of the avalanche. Khan and Mulan are
        swept under by the snow and reemerge quickly. She looks back and sees Shang passed out
        riding the wave of snow</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan calling loudly</speaker>: Shang, Shang! Mulan turns around and rides to
        Shang's position. She picks him up and places him on Khan. She turns Khan around again to be
        riding upstream</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Chien-Po with Ling standing on him and Yao standing on top of Ling</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chien-Po</speaker>: Do you see them?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao extatically</speaker>: Yes! Yao shoots an arrow with a rope attached Perfect!
        Now I'll pull them to safe--Yao grasps at air as the rope completely passed through his
        hands--ty.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan and Shang on Khan with Mushu and Cri-Kee riding up to her on his shield</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu riding on the shield up to Mulan, Khan and Shang speaking loudly, above the
            noise of the avalanche</speaker>: Hey Mulan, I found a lucky cricket.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan speaking loudly</speaker>: We need help! Yao's arrow lands near by Mulan and
        she picks it up and starts to tie the rope to Khan</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu Getting off the shield and carrying Cri-Kee with him</speaker>: Ooo, nice,
        very nice, you can sit by me. Mushu sees that they're about to fall over the cliff. He and
        Cri-Kee look frightened Ahhhhh! We're gonna die! We're gonna die! I know we're gonna die! No
        way we can survive this! Death is coming! Mulan knocks the arrow and shoots it toward
        Yao</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao crying</speaker>: I let them slip through my fingers. Mulan's arrow lands in
        Yao's hands. He grabs on and is pulled toward the cliff, the soldiers grab onto Yao and hold
        him steady near the cliff edge with the rope taught over the cliff</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao</speaker>: Pull</sp>
    <sp>Chien-Po prays as he calmly walks up to the group of soldiers. He lifts them all up and
        pulls backward hauling Mulan, Shang, Khan, Mushu and Cri-Kee to safety</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: I knew we could to it. You da man. Mulan looks pleased Well sorta.
        Mulan grimaces</sp>
    <sp>The soldiers help them up to the cliff</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ling</speaker>: Step back guys, give 'em some air.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang catching his breath</speaker>: Ping, you are the craziest man I've ever met.
        And for that I owe you my life. From now on, you have my trust. Mulan smiles big</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ling</speaker>: Let's hear it for Ping! The bravest of us all.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao lifting his arm high</speaker>: You're king of the mountain!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chien-Po jumping up and down</speaker>: Yes, yes, yes!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan beginning to stand up</speaker>: Ahhh, she clutches her right side</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Ping, what's wrong? Mulan removes her hand slightly to show the
        blood on her hand and seeping through the armour loudly He's wounded, get help! Ping starts
        to pass out. The images of Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po begin to fade as she loses
        consciousness Ping, hold on. Hold on.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to outside of the medic tent. Mulan and Medic are inside. Shang stands by the entrance.
        Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look quite concerned. Ling drums his fingers on his knees. The medic
        comes out from the tent and whispers to Shang. Shang looks astonished and goes into the
        tent. Mulan is lying down. She opens her eyes, sees Shang and smiles at the sight of him.
        She sits up allowing the blanket to fall to her waist revealing her form fitting bandages on
        her chest. She sees Shang's surprised look and realizes her feminine form is noticeable</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan gasping as she covers up</speaker>: Huh, I can explain.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu stepping into the tent</speaker>: Huh? So it's true.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan calling after Shang as he steps out of the tent</speaker>: Shang!</sp>
    <sp>Cut to outside the tent. Chi Fu hauls out Mulan by the arm. Mulan uses her other hand to
        hold the blanket</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: I knew there was something wrong with you. Chi Fu takes off
        Mulan's hair tie and throws her to the ground A woman.</sp>
    <sp>Ling, Yao and Chien-Po are shocked</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu to the troops</speaker>: Trecherous snake.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan on the ground kneeling and hunched over, speaking to Shang</speaker>: My name
        is Mulan. I did it to save my father.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu to the troops</speaker>: High treason!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: I didn't mean for it to go this far.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu getting in Mulan's face and speaking to her while she whinces</speaker>:
        Ultimate dishonor.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: It was the only way. Please believe me.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu to Shang</speaker>: Hmph, Captain?</sp>
    <sp>Shang walks over to Khan and takes the sword out of the scabbard attached to Khan. Khan
        rears back</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu to the soldier by Khan</speaker>: Restrain him.</sp>
    <sp>Shang walks toward Mulan with sword in hand</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao, Ling and Chien-Po rushing toward Mulan</speaker>: Noooooo!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu putting his hand to stop Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po from proceeding
            further</speaker>: You know the law.</sp>
    <sp>Shang stands over Mulan. Mulan looks at Shang then bows her head in anticipation. Shang
        lifts the sword high above his head and throws it down in front of Mulan</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: A life for a life. My debt is repaid. turns and walks towards the
        Imperial City Move out!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu coming up to Shang's face</speaker>: But you can't just...</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang getting in Chi Fu's face</speaker>: I said, "Move out!"</sp>
    <sp>The troops walk off toward the Imperial City leaving Mulan behind with Khan, Cri-Kee, and
        Mushu. Mulan is sitting, shivering. Khan takes his blanket and wraps it around Mulan with
        his mouth and sits behind her. Cri-Kee lights a fire with twigs. When he doesn't get warm,
        he moves under the blanket wrapped around Mulan. Mushu walks toward Mulan carrying a
        stick</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting
        the top shelf, an entourage. Man, all my fine work, ffft. Mushu picks up a dumpling with his
        stick, slumps down in front of the fire Cri-Kee made and begins to cook the dumpling over
        the fire glancing up Hi.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan look of sadness</speaker>: I should never have left home.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Eh, come on, you wanted to save your father's life. Who knew you'd
        end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors, and losing all your friends. You know, you
        just gotta, you gotta learn to let these things go looking as if he's about to cry.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Maybe I didn't go for my father. Maybe what I really wanted was to
        prove I could do things right. So when I looked in the mirror picking up her helmet and
        looking at her reflection in her helmet I'd see someone worthwhile. But I was wrong. I see
        nothing. throws the helmet down and a tear runs down her cheek</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu picking up the helmet and spitting on it</speaker>: Well that's because this
        just needs a little spit, that's all. Let me shine this up for ya wiping the spit to clean
        the helmet and holding it up to Mulan. I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty.
        seeing Mulan is not cheered up by his actions, he shows sorrow on his face The truth is
        we're both frauds. Your ancestors never sent me, they don't even like me. I mean, you risked
        your life to help people you love. I risked your life to help myself. At least you had good
        intentions Mulan smiles.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Cri-Kee jumping on top of the helmet beginning to bawl</speaker>: Chirp, Chirp,
        Chirp. Bawl, Bawl.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: What!? What do you mean you're not lucky? You lied to me? Cri-Kee
        nods to Khan And what are you? A sheep?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan sadly</speaker>: I'll have to face my father sooner or later. Let's go
        home.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Yeah, this ain't gonna be pretty. But, don't you worry, 'kay?
        Things'll work out. We started this thing together and that's how we'll finish. Mushu hugs
        Mulan. Mulan smiles I promise.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Shan-Yu's falcon flying over the avalanche site. Shan-Yu's hand pops out of the snow.
        He gets up and glances around</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu screaming</speaker>: Rrrrrrraaaaaaaaahhh!</sp>
    <sp>Hun Archer, Long-Hair Hun Man, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Bald Man #1, and Hun Bald Man #2 each pop
        out of the snow and join Shan-Yu. They set off towards the Imperial City</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan seeing them from behind, gasps</speaker>: Huh. Mulan runs, grabs her sword,
        mounts Khan, and heads out following the Huns to the Imperial City</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Home is that way! points to the opposite direction Mulan is
        heading</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: I have to do something.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Did you see those Huns!? They popped out of the snow, like
        daisies!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Are we in this together or not?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Cri-Kee emphatically</speaker>: Chirp, Chirp.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Well, let's go kick some Huny buns! Jumps onto Khan and utters
        fighting words as they ride off to the Imperial City Wu Hu Ha Ga, Wu Hu Ha Ga</sp>
    <sp>Cut to the victory parade in the Imperial City. Fireworks go off, kites are flying. The
        drummers march by, followed by the flutist, followed by the acrobats. The Parade Leader
        follows, then Shang and his men, followed by lion dancers</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Parade Leader</speaker>: Make way for the heros of China.</sp>
    <sp>Shang leads the men on horseback, all have sorrowful looks on their faces. Mulan rides up
        through the crowd and stops. She looks around and sees Shang in the parade</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan calling out</speaker>: Shang! riding next to him</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang surprised</speaker>: Mulan?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: The Huns are alive, they're in the city.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: You don't belong here Mulan, go home.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan with a scowl rides khan to the other side of Shang</speaker>: Shang, I saw
        them in the mountains. You have to believe me.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Why should I?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan riding ahead to block Shang's horse</speaker>: Why else would I come back?
        You said you'd trust Ping. Why is Mulan any different?</sp>
    <sp>Shang turns his horse and rides around Mulan and goes forward</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan to Yao, Chien-Po and Ling</speaker>: Keep your eyes open. I know they're
        here. Hya.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan rides off and stops near the entrance to the palace, she dismounts Khan and runs into
        the palace yard</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Now where are you going?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan calling over her shoulder</speaker>: To find someone who will believe me.
        Mulan runs into the palace yard </sp>
    <sp>Cut to the parade procession stopping in front of the Emperor on the steps of the palace.
        Chi Fu stands next to Shang and gives him Shan-Yu's sword. The Lion dancers stop behind
        Shang. A palace man strikes a large gong and the people fall silent</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor</speaker>: My children, heaven smiles down upon the Middle Kingdom. China
        will sleep safely tonight thanks to our brave warriors.</sp>
    <sp>The crowd cheers</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan at the fringe of the crowd</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan approaching Man #1 laying her hand on his shoulder</speaker>: Sir, the
        Emperor's in danger! Man #1 rips his shoulder away from Mulan's touch and moves away
        agitated But the Huns are here! Mulan walks up to Man #2 Please, you have to help me. Man #2
        walks away from Mulan turning to Mushu who is standing near her in the yard No one will
        listen!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry, did you say something?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan irritatedly</speaker>: Mushu!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Hey, you're a girl again, remember?</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Shang holding the sword before the Emperor</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang kneeling down giving the sword to the Emperor</speaker>: Your Majesty, I
        present to you the sword of Shan-Yu.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor</speaker>: I know what this means to you, Captain Li. Your father would
        have been very proud.</sp>
    <sp>Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and takes the sword as Shang is giving it to the Emperor. The
        falcon rises above the roof and drops the sword to Shan-Yu who was sitting next to the
        gargoyles in the shadows blending in. He rises out of the shadows to catch the sword so that
        all the people can see his face. The masses of people gasp at the sight of Shan-Yu. Shang
        begins to draw his sword. All 5 of Shan-Yu's men jump out from behind the dragon knocking
        down Shang and grab the Emperor knocking off his hat. Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 carry the
        Emperor into the Palace. Long-Haired Hun Man and Hun Strong Guy close the palace doors as
        Hun archer knocks his arrow retreating into the Palace to threaten would be rescue
        attempts</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang getting up and running toward the closing doors</speaker>: No.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao beckoning to the other soldiers</speaker>: C'mon.</sp>
    <sp>Shang reaches the palace doors just as they close with all the Huns inside</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu laughs evily</speaker>: Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.</sp>
    <sp>Shang and his soldiers pick up a big stone statue and use it as a battering ram. They are
        unsuccessful at opening the door. Mulan sees what's going on and arrives at the steps</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan to herself</speaker>: They'll never reach the Emperor in time. She looks at
        the columns and runs near to the Shang and his soldiers. She whistles loudly catching the
        soldiers' attention Hey guys, I've got an idea. Mulan runs around the palace to the right
        towards the columns</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Song</speaker>: I'll Make a Man Out of You (reprise) plays in the background during
        the next action sequence</sp>
    <sp>(Be a man) We must be swift as the coursing river (Be a man) With all the force of a great
        typhoon (Be a man) With all the strength of a raging fire Mysterious as the dark side of the
        moon</sp>
    <sp>Yao, Ping and Chien-Po look at one another then drop the statue and follow Mulan. Shang
        looks astonished. Around the corner Yao, Ling and Chien-Po begin to take off their armor and
        dress as women. Once the transformation is complete, they take out their sashes and prepare
        to shimmy up the columns. Shang arrives and taps Mulan on the shoulder. He takes off his
        cape and wraps it around the column to signify that he's coming along. They shimmy up the
        poles together</sp>
    <sp>End song</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 arriving with the Emperor and a high balcony within the
        palace. Shan-Yu drops down from the roof</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu</speaker>: Boo. Shan-Yu steps into the balcony next to the Emperor to Hun
        Bald Man #1 and #2 Guard the door they walk off down the stairs that lead to the balcony.
        pacing around the Emperor Your walls and armies have fallen, and now it's your turn. Bow to
        me.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to the entrance to the stairwell that leads to the balcony. Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 come
        down the stairs and close the door, joining Hun Archer Man, Hun Strong Man and Hun Long-Hair
        Man. Mulan and company are around the corner</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan whispering</speaker>: Okay, any questions?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao whispering</speaker>: Does this dress make me look fat? Mulan slaps him
        Ow.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po walk out smiling, giggling and trying to act lady-like
        including holding fans and waving fans</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Hun Archer</speaker>: Who's there?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Hun Bald Man #2 putting down Hun Bald Man #1's sword</speaker>: Concubines.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Hun Bald Man #1</speaker>: Ugly concubines.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ling waving daintily, speaking to Yao</speaker>: Oh he's so cute.</sp>
    <sp>Hun Bald Man #2 smiles and waves back. Hun Bald Man #1 elbows Hun Bald Man #2. A bitten
        apple falls out from beneath Ling's dress. He pulls the dress out and turns so as not to
        expose the loss of figure</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang from around the corner putting his head down into his hand</speaker>:
        Aww.</sp>
    <sp>Shan-Yu's Falcon sees Shang and starts to squawk. Mushu from above singes off all his
        feathers with his fire breathing</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu to Cri-Kee sitting above him</speaker>: Now that's what I call Mongolian
        Barbeque. Cri-Kee rolls on his back in laughter. The stunned falcon doesn't do anything</sp>
    <sp>Hun Bald Man #2 picks up the apple and offers it back to Ling. Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po pull
        out the fruit they were using to simulate a woman's chest. Chien-Po takes his watermelons
        and smashes them on the heads of Hun Bald Man #1 and #2. He then smashes their two heads
        together and they fall to the ground. Ling pushes the apple into Hun Long-Hair man's mouth
        and kicks him in the stomach causing Hun Long-Hair Man to stoop over on the ground. Ling
        uses his head to crack Hun Long-Hair Man's back. Hun Strong Guy lunges his fist at Yao and
        misses, he misses with the other. Yao grabs the outstretched arm and flips him over onto his
        head. Mulan kicks away Hun Archer Man's bow and knocked arrow, avoids his strike by turning
        her back to Hun Archer. She follows with a left elbow to the stomach followed by a left
        upper cut knocking Hun Archer to the ground. She sits on his back and uses the bow to pull
        his head back</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan calling out</speaker>: Shang, GO!</sp>
    <sp>Shang runs out from behind the corner, charges through the door and runs up the stairs</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Shan-Yu and the Emperor on the balcony</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu</speaker>: I tire of your arrogance old man. yelling and putting his sword
        at the emperor's throat Bow to me!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor</speaker>: No matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow to
        it.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu</speaker>: Then you will kneel in pieces. Shan-Yu draws back his sword to
        strike the Emperor</sp>
    <sp>Shang runs up in time to block the striking blow of Shan-Yu with his sword. Shang swipes
        with his sword. Shan-Yu grabs Shang's arm and throws him towards the edge. Shang grabs onto
        a column and he flies over the edge and uses the momentum to swing back and kick Shan-Yu.
        Shan-Yu falls to the ground, Shang on top of him. Shang punches Shan-Yu. Shan-Yu grabs Shang
        and rolls over forcing Shang to be on his back underneath him. Shang uses his knee to hit
        Shan-Yu from behind as he uses his hand to hit him in the head. Shang forces Shan-Yu onto
        his back and grabs his arm pulling it behind Shan-Yu's back. Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao and Ling
        enter the balcony from the stairs</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Chien-Po, get the Emperor.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chien-Po standing in front of the Emperor and bowing</speaker>: Sorry, your
        Majesty. </sp>
    <sp>Chien-Po lifts up the Emperor and runs over to Mulan who is by a rope attached to a column
        in the balcony. Chien-Po uses his sash as a pulley and rides down the rope to the ground.
        Shan Yu watches the Emperor leave</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu</speaker>: No! </sp>
    <sp> Shan-Yu uses his free arm to elbow Shang in the face. Shan-Yu gets up and head-butts Shang
        and throws him to the ground. Shang lies limp. Mulan watches Shang fall then she looks over
        the edge at Ling and Yao now on the ground. Chien-Po runs off the screen out of sight</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao motioning her to follow</speaker>: Come on!</sp>
    <sp>Mulan looks down at Shang with a worried look. Shan-Yu begins to approach Mulan and the
        rope. Mulan looks at the approaching Shan-Yu and then down to spy his sword. Thinking
        quickly, Mulan grabs Shan-Yu's sword and cuts the taught rope. Shan-Yu reaches the edge and
        grabs for the falling rope unsuccessfully as Mulan leaves the sword embedded in the column
        and runs to Shang's position. The crowd cheers</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu</speaker>: No! He looks down at the crowd and realizes he cannot find the
        Emperor among the throng of people Yrraaaaahhhh!</sp>
    <sp>Shan-Yu turns and looks back and sees Mulan looking concerned, holding up Shang. Shan-Yu
        pulls out his sword lodged in the column and heads toward them. As Shang sees Shan-Yu
        approaching, he puts his arm in front of Mulan to ask her to leave and takes out his knife.
        Mulan slides away. Shan-Yu comes up to Shang, knocks away his knife, slaps him in the face,
        and grabs Shang by the shirt collar</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu in Shang's face</speaker>: You, you took away my victory.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan's shoe hits Shan-Yu in the head and bounces back to her feet. Shan-Yu turns toward
        Mulan</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: No! I did! Mulan pulls her hair back to look like she did when she
        was a soldier</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu looking at Mulan</speaker>: The soldier from the mountains.</sp>
    <sp>Shan-Yu drops Shang and starts after Mulan as she puts on her shoe and runs down the stairs
        and through the doors to the balcony. She closes the door with the latch falling in place
        right behind her. She leans against the doors. Shan-Yu punches a hole in one door with his
        fist. Mulan runs away from the doors down the corridor. Mushu riding Shan-Yu's falcon like a
        horse catches up with Mulan</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: So what's the plan?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Ummmm.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: You don't have a plan?!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Hey, I'm making this up as I...looks out a window and spies the
        firework tower go. Mushu--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: I'm way ahead of you sister. C'mon Cri-Kee. Mushu and Cri-Kee jump
        onto a kite and use the wings to soar over toward the fireworks tower</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Shan-Yu. Shan-Yu breaks through the doors and catches up to Mulan swinging his sword
        wildly knocking down a support column with every swipe. Mulan runs and ducks his every blow.
        Mulan climbs up a column to get out of Shan-Yu's reach. Shan-Yu slices the base of the
        column causing it to fall and break through the outer wall. Mulan screams as the beam falls
        and comes to a stop. Mulan gets up on the beam and jumps up to catch onto the awning. She
        looks off to her right and spies Mushu arriving at the fireworks tower</sp>
    <sp>Zoom in on the fireworks tower. Mushu lands near Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (the firework
        lighters) on the edge of the tower </sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Citizens, I need firepower.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Barry Cook</speaker>: Who are you?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu Mushu (using the wings from the kite) and Cri-Kee with wings spread like
            batman</speaker>: You're worst nightmare.</sp>
    <sp>Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft jump off the tower and plunge toward the ground</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan. She pulls herself onto the roof and climbs up to the crest</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Man in Crowd #1</speaker>: On the roof.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Man in Crowd #2</speaker>: Look!</sp>
    <sp>Mulan lines up where she is standing with the fireworks tower across the way. Shan-Yu breaks
        through the roof behind Mulan surprising her. Mulan backs away and searches for something on
        her person to help her against Shan-Yu. She finds a her fan, takes it out, and opens it</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shan-Yu</speaker>: It looks like you're out of ideas.</sp>
    <sp>Shan-Yu lunges with his sword. Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right through
        the fan. She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so that
        Shan-Yu loses his grip. The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle
        slipping off the fan with her sword movement</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Not quite. calling out Ready, Mushu?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu behind Shan-Yu tied to a large rocket firework</speaker>: I am ready, baby.
        He blows fire onto a stick and hands the stick to Cri-Kee who's standing on the firework
        Light me! Cri-Kee lights the fuse</sp>
    <sp>Shan-Yu approaches Mulan. Using the sword as a lever, Mulan lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him in
        the face then sweep kicks him and he falls to the ground. Mulan picks the sword back up and
        stabs it into Shan-Yu's cape. The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls him toward Shan-Yu.
        Mulan lies flat down on the left side of the roof. Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and
        tries to run, but the sword has him pinned to the spot. The rocket hits Shan-Yu square in
        the belly propelling him toward the firework tower. Mushu grabbed onto the sword as he went
        by letting the rocket do the work. Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu's tail. Mulan jumps back up to
        the crest of the roof and runs away from the fireworks tower grabbing Mushu and Cri-Kee off
        the sword</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan while running</speaker>: Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the
        roof.</sp>
    <sp>The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses of explosions and fireworks
        to fly everywhere. Mulan jumps near the edge of the roof. Propelled by the explosion, she
        grabs onto a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide down. She looks
        down and releases her grip so that she lands on the back of Shang causing the two of them to
        fall to the ground. Shan-Yu's sword follows and lands on the ground near by</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu landing and flying backwards on his butt a couple of times pointing at the
            fireworks</speaker>: Ah ha ha ha ha. Mushu's catches Cri-Kee with antenna on fire as
        Cri-Kee falls toward him to Cri-Kee You are a lucky bug. Mushu pinches out the fire on
        Cri-Kee's antenna</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu walking down the stairs in a tattered outfit and slightly burned</speaker>:
        That was a deliberate attempt on my life. Where is she? Now she's done it. What a mess.
        Shang and troops push Mulan behind them to protect her to Shang Stand aside, that creature's
        not worth protecting.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang in Chi Fu's face</speaker>: She's a hero.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: 'Tis a woman. She will never be worth anything.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang grabbing Chi Fu by the shirt collar</speaker>: Listen, you pompous--</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor walking down the steps</speaker>: That is enough!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Your Majesty, I can explain.</sp>
    <sp>The Emperor motions for Shang to stand aside. Shang and his men part giving the Emperor a
        clear path to Mulan. Mulan steps forward and bows before the Emperor. Chi Fu with a sinister
        look waits to write down the words of the Emperor</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor</speaker>: I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan. You stole your
        father's armor, ran away from home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding
        officer, dishonored the Chinese army, destroyed my palace, AND...you have saved us all. the
        Emperor bows to Mulan</sp>
    <sp>Chi Fu looks at the Emperor actions astonishingly then immediately falls prostrate before
        Mulan. Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po follow suit. Mulan looks up then turns around hardly
        believing what she sees as the entire Chinese population within the palace grounds fall
        prostrate on the ground in a wave like pattern, bowing to her. Khan bows with Mushu and
        Cri-Kee on his back</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: My little baby's all grown up and savin' China. to Cri-Kee You
        have a tissue?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor</speaker>: Chi Fu,</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu</speaker>: Your Excellency?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor</speaker>: See to it that this woman is made a member of my council.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu muttering to himself</speaker>: A member of your coun...realizing what the
        Emperor has said what? stutters But there are no council positions open, your Majesty.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor to Mulan</speaker>: Very well then, you can have his job pointing out Chi
        Fu.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Chi Fu wobbling to and fro</speaker>: What?...My...faints</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan smiles big then turns to the Emperor and bows</speaker>: With all due
        respect, your Excellency. I have been away from home long enough.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor taking off his pendant</speaker>: Then take this, so your family will know
        what you have done for me. And this handing her the sword of Shan-Yu so the world will know
        what you have done for China.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan takes the gifts and hugs the Emperor</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Yao</speaker>: Is she allowed to do that? Shang, Ling, and Chien-Po shrug</sp>
    <sp>Mulan walks away from the Emperor and is embraced by Yao and Ling. Chien-Po comes up and
        lifts all three of them off the ground in a big bear hug. Chien-Po lets them all back to the
        ground again. Mulan walks toward Shang and stops in front of him. As Shang begins to speak
        Mulan starts to smile anticipating something good</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: Um...Mulan grins You... Mulan smiles You fight good.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan smile turning into disappointment</speaker>: Oh, thank you. Mulan walks
        toward Khan</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang</speaker>: turning toward Mulan and grunts with disappointment in himself:
        Hmm.</sp>
    <sp>Mulan mounts Khan</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Khan, let's go home.</sp>
    <sp>Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the stair case back down to
        ground level. The crowd cheers al the while. The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his
        throat</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor to Shang</speaker>: The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare
        and beautiful of all.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang dumbfounded</speaker>: Sir?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Emperor</speaker>: You don't meet a girl like that ev'ry dynasty. The emperor puts
        on his hat and walks back up the steps to his palace</sp>
    <sp>Cut to Mulan's home, her father is sitting beneath the blossom tree. A blossom falls and
        lands on his leg. Mulan appears at the threshold and moves toward her father. Fa Zhou sees
        her approaching and starts to stand</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou</speaker>: Mulan. </sp>
    <sp>Mulan quickly moves in front of her father and kneels causing him to sit back down</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Father, I brought you the sword of Shan-Yu hands the sword to Fa
        Zhou and the crest of the Emperor hands the crest to Fa Zhou. with head bowed They're gifts
        to honor the Fa Family.</sp>
    <sp>Fa Zhou takes the gifts and throws them down to the ground beside him to the surprise of
        Mulan. He bends down and holds her arms outstretched</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Zhou</speaker>: The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter. Fa
        Zhou wipes away Mulan's tear then hugs Mulan I've missed you so.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: I've missed you too Baba.</sp>
    <sp>Fa li and Grandma Fa watch from the doorway</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Fa Li sighing</speaker>: Ahhhhh</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Grandma Fa</speaker>: Great, she brings home a sword. If you ask me she should have
        brought home a ma--leaving her mouth open when she sees Shang</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang just arriving</speaker>: Excuse me, does Fa Mulan live here?</sp>
    <sp>Grandma Fa's mouth stays open as she and Fa Li point toward Mulan's position. Shang walks
        toward Mulan and Fa Zhou</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Grandma Fa</speaker>: Woo, sign me up for the next war.</sp>
    <sp>Shang approaches seeing Fa Zhou</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang bows before Fa Zhou and speaks confidently</speaker>: Honorable Fa Zhou
        I--Mulan Mulan steps up. Shang sees her and speaks insecurely Uh...Uh...You forgot your
        helmet. Ah but well, actually it's your helmet, isn't it?...handing the helmet toward Fa
        Zhou I mean...</sp>
    <sp>Fa Zhou motions with his head for Mulan to take over. Mulan holds the helmet Shang
        offers</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Would you like to stay for dinner?</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Grandma Fa speaking from stage right</speaker>: Would you like to stay forever?
        Mulan shakes her head with a smile at Grandma Fa's statement</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Shang reassuredly to Mulan</speaker>: Dinner would be great.</sp>
    <sp>Cut to First Ancestor grinning happily looking at the scene through the temple window. He
        watches Mulan hand the helmet back to Fa Zhou. Mushu climbs up to the window sill by First
        Ancestor's his head</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu tugging on First Ancestor's ear</speaker>: C'mon, who did a good job? C'mon,
        tell me who did a good job.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor hesitantly</speaker>: Oh, all right. You can be a guardian
        again.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Yeeeeeahhhhhhh. Mushu runs to his post and Cri-Kee bangs the gong
        awakening all the ancestors</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu</speaker>: Take it Cri-Kee.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Song</speaker>: True to Your Heart -- No characters sing in the song</sp>
    <sp>Ancestor 1 does a dance from Pulp Fiction while Ancestor 3 does the Hand Jive</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Ancestor 3 spoken to Ancestor 1</speaker>: She get's it from my side of the
        family.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mushu spoken while swinging on a chain</speaker>: Call out for egg rolls!</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor disgusted</speaker>: Guardians.</sp>
    <sp>Mushu lands on the steps outside the temple. Mulan walks up to him and rests besides him on
        the steps</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Mulan</speaker>: Thanks, Mushu kisses Mushu on the forehead.</sp>
    <sp><speaker>Little Brother</speaker>: Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark </sp>
    <sp>Little brother runs up the steps and into the temple with the bag of grain tied to him. The
        chickens follow him in</sp>
    <sp><speaker>First Ancestor annoyed</speaker>: Mushu!</sp>
